# Decentralized Commercial Janitorial Service Management System

This repository contains a blockchain-based solution for managing commercial janitorial services in a decentralized manner. The system consists of several smart contracts that handle different aspects of the service workflow.

## Overview

Our decentralized platform streamlines the commercial cleaning industry by connecting facility managers with service providers while ensuring transparency, accountability, and quality control through blockchain technology.

## Smart Contracts

The system is built around four core smart contracts:

1. **Facility Registration Contract**: Stores and manages details about commercial properties requiring janitorial services
2. **Cleaning Schedule Contract**: Defines and tracks cleaning tasks, frequencies, and requirements
3. **Staff Verification Contract**: Maintains a registry of verified cleaning personnel with their qualifications
4. **Quality Inspection Contract**: Records and tracks service quality metrics and customer satisfaction

## Features

- Transparent service agreements and history
